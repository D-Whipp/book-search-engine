# Frozen Journey | Book Search Engine

## Description

Welcome to Frozen Journey! This is my Book Search Engine app with an awesome name given to it by Heroku.com. Frozen Journey was created for the reading enthusiast. It's sole purpose is to help it's users keep track of books they're interest in by allowing them to search for books and add them to their list.

You can find this app's repository [here](https://github.com/D-Whipp/book-search-engine).
